# LLMRPG-Core

LLMRPG-Core is a lightweight, extensible framework for building **LLM-driven text RPGs** with **JRPG-style systems**, persistent world state, and modular rule design.

This project is not a game.
It is a **game engine for narrative-first RPGs**, where large language models handle storytelling, while the engine enforces rules, state, and progression.

## Design Philosophy

- **LLM-first, but engine-driven**
  - LLMs generate narrative, dialogue, and choices
  - The engine owns state, rules, and persistence

- **JRPG-inspired systems**
  - Stats, development, corruption, economy, time cycles
  - Data-driven events and progression

- **Worldbook & Event Based**
  - Worlds are content modules
  - Events are conditional, deterministic, and replayable

- **Extensible by design**
  - Rules, UI, and content are all pluggable
  - One core, many worlds

## What This Is

- A runtime for text-based RPGs powered by LLMs
- A framework for persistent, system-heavy narrative games
- A foundation for SillyTavern-style experiences without chat-centric constraints

## What This Is NOT

- A visual RPG engine
- A chat frontend
- A content-only worldbook
